# pands-project
In this project we will be working on a Fisher's Iris data set. The objective is to make a research on te data set using Python, add the documentation and code to investigate it. The documentation will be summarised in this readme file. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First we will download the data set called iris.data 
Create a program named analysis.py. The program shouldbe able to:
  1. Output a summary of each variable to a single text file,
  2. Save a histogram of each variable to png files, and
  3. Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
  4. Perfors any other analysis you think is appropriate
